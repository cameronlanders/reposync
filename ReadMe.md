# Reposync  
## Auto-sync github repositories  
  
Reposync is a python program that synchronizes a local github repository to it's origin on Github.  

* Reposync is intended to be called from scheduled tasks to do autmated commits and pushes to keep any repository in sync with it's online origin.
* Both the `reposync.py` and `log.py` scripts are compiled to executables for use in the scheduled tasks. 
* The program includes full logging of the output returned from each git command. The logging feature is implemented in the included log.py script.
* This program only runs on Windows. A Unix/Linux port is TBD at the time of this writing.
 
### Important:   
* It is critical that the location of **git.exe** is already included in your PATH environment variable so that git commands can be run from any directory on your machine. If not, you will need to add it. 

### If you want to recompile the scripts:  
If you need to make changes to the python script, you'll need to use pyinstaller to recompile the executable. From within the folder that contains the original reposync.py script, run the following commands to compile both the reposync.py script and the log.py script:  

    pyinstaller --onefile reposync.py
    pyinstaller --onefile log.py

* Obviously this assumes you have pyinstaller installed. If not, use `pip` to install it. 

The commands shown above will compile the reposync script to an executable file (reposync.exe) and the log script to an executable file (log.exe). A folder called "_dist_" will be created, and the executable files will be placed there. 

> The scripts have already been compiled to executables in the dist folder within this repository. If you do not need to make any git command changes, the executables should be ready to use as they are.
 
## Deploying and Operating Reposync:  

At a high level, once you have cloned the repo to your local machine, the following two steps are all you need to do in order to deploy Reposync in your environment. Details for creating the scheduled tasks are explained below.  

1. Copy the executable files to a permanent location which you will specify as the path to reposync.exe in each scheduled task.
2. Create a scheduled task for each repository you wish to automate, using the steps described below.  

### Creating Your Scheduled tasks  
  
**Use these steps to configure a scheduled task for each repository you wish to automate:**  

* Open a new scheduled task. 
* Choose _Start A Program_ and specify the full path and filename to reposync.exe as the program to be started. 
* Specify the path to the local repository from which you wish to push commits as a command line argument: this is the full drive and path to the local repo root directory (where .git resides) where you initially cloned the repo. Example: "D:\MyRepo" 
    * The local repository path must be placed in the `Arguments` field in the scheduled task's `Actions` section.  
    * The local repository path must be enclosed in quotes, regardless whether or not there are spaces in the path. This is necessary in order to successfully pass the path as a command line argument to the python executable.  
* Specify the name of the target branch on GitHub to which you want to push commits. 
    * The branch name must be placed in the `Arguments` field in the scheduled task's `Actions` section. It must be added _after_ the local repository path described above.  
    * The branch name must be enclosed in quotes. All arguments to a scheduled tsask command must always be in quotes, regardless whether or not there are spaces in them, as explained earlier.  
 
* Specify whatever schedule you want: daily, weekly, hourly, etc. based upon how often you expect to make changes to the local repository.  

When the scheduled task fires, Reposync will change to the specified local repository directory. It will then execute the following git commands to generate new commit to the online github repo: 
 
    git add . 
    git checkout (branch name)
    git commit -m "Updated by Reposync." 
    git push

Regardless whether or not the local branch had any changes, the results will be formatted and logged to a file, whose name contains the current date. The log files will be placed in the same directory where the Reposync executables reside. So each day Reposync will add a new log file in this location. It's up to you to remove old log files periodically. 

Because the names of the log files begin with the date, you can probably think of lots of ways to create a simple program or script that deletes the oldest ones on some periodic basis, just based on their filenames.
